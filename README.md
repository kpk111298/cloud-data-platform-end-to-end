# End-to-End Cloud Data Platform

This project showcases a complete data engineering workflow, from raw data ingestion
to analytics-ready business metrics.

It is designed to mirror how modern data platforms are built in production
environments using layered architecture.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Raw data ingestion
- Reference data management
- Clean (silver) data modeling
- Gold-layer business metrics
- SQL-based transformations
- Warehouse-first design thinking

## Architecture
See `docs/architecture.md` for full details.

## Key Analytics
- Revenue by country
- Orders by status
- Customer lifetime value

## Why This Project
This repository is built to demonstrate practical data engineering skills,
not toy examples. Every layer reflects real-world design patterns used in
enterprise data platforms.
